# DataWarehouse

Used the Oracle 12c server on the Business School server for most assignments and Oracle through TCP/IP connections so we do not need to be on campus. Installed the Oracle SQL Developer client on our PC. In addition, installed the campus virtual private network (VPN). 

For assignment 1, we used WebPivotTable Since WebPivotTable is Javascript based, it executes inside a browser so installation is not necessary. For assignment 3, we used Pentaho Data Integration to perform data cleaning, processing, and loading tasks. 

Five assignments, a three part case study, the assignments cover pivot table usage, conceptual data warehouse design, data integration, query formulation, and materialized views. The case study involves three parts to provide the opportunity to apply and extend skills about conceptual data warehouse design, data integration, and query formulation.
